2. There are three logins: Admin, Customer, and Employee.
3. It is recommended to open three windows for the three logins (better to use different accounts or incognito pages).
4. Use the following sample credentials to log in for different roles.
  **a. Admin -> email: admin@email.com   password: Admin123@
   b. Customer -> email: lily@email.com  password: Lily123@
   c. Employee -> email: supunk@email.com  password: Supunk123@**
5. Try using the functions from each view. (eg, Purchase spare parts as a customer and place an order. Go from the employee's side and see the order list and inventory being updated. Also, employees can process orders and update their status.)
6. Admin view has a few analytics pages related to different functions of the system. They provide the admin a comprehensive overview of the overall business, its customers, and finances.
